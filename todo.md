# Vera Poker TODO

## Bug Fix: Buy-in / Leave not writing transactions
- [x] Backend: Write buy_in transaction record when player joins table (deduct from balance)
- [x] Backend: Write leave_table transaction record when player leaves table (return chips to balance)
- [x] Backend: Write rebuy transaction record when player rebuys chips
- [x] Admin: New "Game Flow" tab in user detail panel showing buy_in / leave_table / rebuy with summary stats
- [x] DB: Extended transactions.type enum to include buy_in, leave_table, rebuy
